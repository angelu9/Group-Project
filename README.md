TRAVEL TREK – What is it? What does it do?  Or maybe describe a scenario where you could use TRAVEL TREK
-Here’s where 2 people can describe the app to the audience – feature and benefits - not necessarily the coding or development, but the need and reason for its purpose and for whom is it intended? (eg. Demographic? Could be travelers of all ages – who want to travel, see and visit key points, interesting places, “must see” places, and “off the beaten path” type places.
-Present to audience // Sell it, sizzle it!  Travel the world from your ap!!
The Minimum Viable Product
-The ap takes in search information from the user and uses several API’s to gather the information and display it on the screen.
-It displays Trending news and articles about your search.
-It displays hi-def photos taken by regular people/travelers who upload their photos
-It displays videos also taken by regular amateur travelers
-It also shows places on a second level – based on  your geo-location “in country” (ie. Once you’re there) so you can find the nearest greatest local pub or restaurant.
-Marketing   (NOTE: Remember, we should all be “… selling the vision and delivering the minimum feature set to visionaries, not everyone (ie. Not the general public.)
Future product development (The “ice-box”)
1.    We would like to display a Google Map when clicking on places.
2.    Another possibility is to find an API that shows local events going on at that time.  (eg. local farmer’s market, seasonal parades, local festivals, etc)
3.    We could also add an entertainment search that can call an API that has upcoming bands, concerts,  theatre performances, etc.
This is a brief outline of what we could say in the presentation
